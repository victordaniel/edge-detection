They  proposed an authentic score of an edge using the clustering property of social network graphs.
The authentic score of an edge is determined by the difference of the actual and the expected number of edges that link the two groups of nodes that are around the investigating edge.
They  used random graph generation models to predict the number of edges between the two groups of nodes. 
The edges with low authentic scores, which are also called weak links in this paper, are likely to be outliers.

<p>
Edges that link the nodes from different clusters are considered as outliers.
<b><u>Limitations</u><br>
1. one shall not classify all weak links as outliers since they are part of the normal graph data. <br>
2. many outlier edges do not happen between the groups. <br>
3. many graphs do not contain easily partitionable groups</b><br>

Detection of missing edges (or link prediction) is the opposite technique of outlier edge detection.
These algorithms find missing edges between pairs of nodes in a graph.
